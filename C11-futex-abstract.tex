We present a new algorithm and implementation of a lock primitive that
is based on Linux' native lock interface, the \texttt{futex} system
call. It allows us to assemble compiler support for atomic data
structures that can not be handled through specific hardware
instructions.  Such a tool is needed for C11's atomics
interface because here an \code{_Atomic} qualification can be attached
to almost any data type. Our lock data structure for that purpose
meets very specific criteria concerning its field of operation and its
performance. By that we are able to outperform gcc's
\texttt{libatomic} library by around 60\%.
