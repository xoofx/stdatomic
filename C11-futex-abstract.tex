The implementation of C11's atomic interface needs compiler support
for the individual atomic operations and library supports for the
cases where no low-level atomic instruction is available and a lock
must be taken. A lock data structure for that purpose has to meet
very specific criteria for its field of operation and its
performance. We present a new algorithm and implementation of such a
specific lock data structure that is based on Linux' lock interface,
the \texttt{futex} system calls. It allows us to assemble compiler support
for atomics and OS support for inactive thread sleeps into an
efficient tool that is able to outperform the compiler's \emph{native}
library by around 60\%.
